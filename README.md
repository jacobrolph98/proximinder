## Proximity Reminder

### This app is still a work in progress

Android application using Kotlin to notify users with a customisable message upon being within a certain range of a set location. <br/>
Makes use of [Leku Location Picker](https://github.com/AdevintaSpain/Leku) for selecting a position.<br/>
User can create, edit and delete reminders, and optionally name locations rather than use latitude/longitude.<br/>
Uses location services to create GeoFences which can trigger notifications based on proximity. (WIP)<br/>
Allows google sign-in to save reminders on cloud for transferring to new phones. (WIP)
